This project roughly follows Kent Beck's Money Example as described in
Part I of his "Test-Driven Development by Example" book.
The main differences are due to the code being written in C++ rather
than Java, and using the GoogleTest test framework.
This branch mirrors the master. Master was developed under Linux, here
we built everything under MSVS10 (Windows).
The only external dependency (aside from C++ std stuff) is the gTest framework. 
I'm sure that this can be redone to give a cleaner or "better"
implementation, but for teaching purposes, this is Good Enough.
